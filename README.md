# Reality Bubbles ðŸ”µðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ 

Samples of using three.js and other tools to visualize "echo chamber" dynamics in population groups.   
This project aims to quantify misinformation as noise that distorts information channel feeds.

Check back as this project is updated. For now, there is a single starting script which can be viewed deployed [here.](https://cheddarbutler.com/work/animationstation/interactive-spheres-v2.html)  

## 3.24.25 Cursor Builds Coming

Here is a dedicated [space](https://github.com/Photon1c/EnterpriseCursorBuilds) to store the quickly growing amount of Cursor-built projects. Reality Bubbles is also the perfect candidate to build different types of simulations, stay tuned once these are in the production stage. In the meantime the [immune system simulator](https://github.com/Photon1c/immunesystemsimulator) is out. It also uses Three.js and relies on using spheres to represent cells.  

## Update 3.2.25

[Version 3](https://cheddarbutler.com/work/animationstation/interactive-spheres-v3.html) of the script is out! The aim is to connect an LLM instance to the page to give it access for editing and manipulating the spheres.
